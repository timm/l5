# A little light learning library, in LUA

For the last 20 years, my graduate students have explored explainable AI, multi-objective optimization, semi-supervised learning, configuration, planning, 
etc, etc. Can I summarize all the work? Code it up in under 1000 lines of code? Refactor it into a library of learning tools that can be mixed and matched
as required?

[Let's take a look and see...](http://menzies.us/lua/about.html).
