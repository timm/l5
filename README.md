# A lean little learning library, in LUA

For the last 20 years, my graduate students have explored explainable AI, multi-objective optimization, semi-supervised learning, configuration, planning, 
etc, etc. Can I summarize all the work? Code it up in under 1000 lines of code? Refactor it into a library of learning tools that can be mixed and matched
as required?

[Let me see....](http://menzies.us/l5/about.html).

Now that was interestinga  . Underneath all these seemingly different
applications is a  small class library that can be mixed and matched
in many ways. Here's an idea: before we leap to complex solutions 
(that are CPU hungry, that are hard to understand), perhaps we should
try something simpler first.  If the simpler methods work fine, then 
we can go home early. Else, we'd have a baseline
approach which lets us appreciate the value of more complex solutions.
